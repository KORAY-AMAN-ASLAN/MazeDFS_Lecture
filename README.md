# MazeDFS: Maze Generator and Solver

## Description
MazeDFS is a Python application that generates and solves mazes using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This project was developed as part of a teaching lecture for students on the Superprof platform, where I teach programming, mathematics, and languages. The application creates a maze of a specified dimension and visually represents the maze and the solution path from start to finish.

## Installation
To run MazeDFS, you will need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, the program requires \`matplotlib\` and \`numpy\` libraries for generating visualizations and managing arrays, respectively.

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KORAY-AMAN-ASLAN/MazeDFS_Lecture.git

# Install required Python libraries
pip install matplotlib numpy
\`\`\`

## Usage
To start the application, run the \`MazeDFS.py\` script from the terminal. You will be prompted to enter the dimensions for the maze, and the program will display the generated maze and the solution path.

\`\`\`bash
python MazeDFS.py
\`\`\`

## Maze Visualization
Here's an example of a generated maze and its solution path, created by the MazeDFS application:
